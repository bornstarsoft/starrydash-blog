Nintendo Switch Online has just made a significant addition to its SNES library by introducing three classic games, including the long-awaited Mario & Wario, which marks the first-ever release of this Japanese title outside of Japan. This addition not only expands the nostalgic offerings for gamers but also highlights Nintendo's commitment to preserving its rich gaming history.

Mario & Wario, developed by Game Freak before they became famous for Pokmon, is a unique puzzle platformer that utilizes the Super Famicom Mouse. Players guide Mario through challenging levels while overcoming obstacles created by Wario. The inclusion of this title on Switch Online is particularly exciting, as it allows a new generation of players to experience a game that was previously inaccessible in the West.

Joining this lineup are Bubsy in Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind and Fatal Fury Special, both of which have their own unique charm and fanbases. As Nintendo continues to revive classic titles, one can't help but wonder what other hidden gems might be next on their list for re-release. Will we see more obscure titles make their way to the West? Only time will tell.
