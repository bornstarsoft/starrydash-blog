After two decades of anticipation, the legendary game "Infinity" is finally making its debut on the Game Boy Color in Q4 of 2025. This tactical RPG, originally developed by Affinix Software, showcases a unique strategic battle system and a rich narrative that has captured the hearts of retro gaming enthusiasts. With the backing of Incube8 Games, this once-abandoned project has been resurrected, offering fans a chance to experience a fully realized RPG that pushes the limits of the beloved handheld console.

The game tells the gripping tale of a nameless evil awakening beneath the earth, threatening to plunge two rival nations into war. Players will navigate through a beautifully crafted world filled with over 30 explorable areas and more than 100 items, all rendered in stunning 8-bit graphics. With five playable characters and a compelling storyline, "Infinity" promises to be one of the most anticipated releases for the Game Boy Color.

As we look forward to its release, it's exciting to think about how this revival of a classic game will resonate with both nostalgic fans and new players alike. Will "Infinity" redefine the retro gaming experience for a new generation? Only time will tell.
