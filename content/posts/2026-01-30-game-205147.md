The latest State of the Game Industry survey by the Game Developers Conference (GDC) reveals a striking trend: developers are showing a marked preference for creating games on the PS5 and Switch 2 compared to Xbox. With only 20% of developers expressing interest in Xbox Series X/S, this figure pales in comparison to the 40% who are keen on PS5 and 39% for Switch 2. This shift highlights a significant change in developer sentiment towards Microsofts console, which has historically been a strong contender in the gaming market.

Interestingly, while Xbox continues to push its multiplatform strategy, the survey indicates that audience reach and business model success are top priorities for developers when choosing platforms. With 80% of respondents favoring PC as their primary development platform, its clear that the landscape is evolving. As Xbox plans to release major titles on PS5 alongside its own console, it raises questions about the future of exclusivity and platform loyalty in the gaming industry.

As we look ahead, it will be fascinating to see how these preferences shape the gaming landscape and whether Xbox can regain its footing among developers. Will we see a resurgence in interest, or is this a sign of a more permanent shift?
