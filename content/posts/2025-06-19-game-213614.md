NINES has just dropped an exciting announcement for puzzle enthusiasts: their upcoming game, **Pipeworks Puzzle**, is set to redefine the classic tile sliding puzzle genre. This game not only promises engaging gameplay but also features charming visuals and a soothing soundtrack, making it an appealing choice for gamers looking for a relaxing experience.

In **Pipeworks Puzzle**, players will step into the shoes of a plumber at a bustling construction site. The challenge lies in rearranging disordered pipe pieces to match a provided blueprint, all within a grid-based arena. With movement restricted to the cardinal directions, strategy becomes key. Players will receive guidance from a quirky support character named ‘Boss’, designed by the talented PokuriMio, known for their captivating art streams on Twitch.

Currently, **Pipeworks Puzzle** is available for wishlisting on Steam, and doing so can unlock exciting features like an endless mode and a speedrun mode. A demo is also on the horizon, allowing players to get a taste of the fun before the official release later this year. Will you be adding this game to your wishlist?
