Fans are buzzing with excitement as they believe Nintendo may have inadvertently revealed upcoming titles for the Nintendo Switch Online service. A recent trailer showcased a blurred section that appears to hint at several beloved N64 games, including the highly sought-after Super Smash Bros. This speculation has ignited discussions across social media platforms, with many eager to see these classic titles added to the service.

Highlighted by keen-eyed fans, the blurred artwork could potentially represent games like Donkey Kong 64, Forsaken 64, and Glover.

As Nintendo continues to expand its classic games library, including recent additions from the GameCube era, the community is left wondering what other surprises lie ahead.
