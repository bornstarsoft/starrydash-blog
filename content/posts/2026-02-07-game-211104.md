In a significant move to bolster its global gaming presence, JetSynthesys has acquired the popular merge puzzle game EverMerge, which has amassed over $350 million in lifetime revenue. This acquisition not only highlights JetSynthesys' ambition to expand its gaming ecosystem but also underscores the game's impressive performance in Western markets, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. With EverMerge ranked among the top 100 highest-grossing mobile games of all time, this strategic acquisition is poised to open new avenues for growth and engagement in emerging markets like India.
