In a surprising turn of events, Romero Games has officially denied rumors of its closure following significant funding cuts from a publisher, later identified as Microsoft. The studio, founded by industry veterans John and Brenda Romero, confirmed that while their unannounced first-person shooter project faced cancellation, they are actively exploring new partnerships with several interested publishers to revive the game.

The situation has left many employees in shock, with reports suggesting that the entire studio faced layoffs after the abrupt funding withdrawal. However, Romero Games has reassured the public that they are still operational and are working diligently to reassess their staffing and project plans. The studio's commitment to transparency and collaboration with potential publishers highlights their resilience in the face of adversity.

As the gaming community watches closely, the question remains: can Romero Games secure the support needed to bring their project to fruition? The outcome could significantly impact the studio's future and the broader gaming landscape.
