As we approach 2026, SEGA is gearing up for a double celebration, not just for Sonic the Hedgehog but also for the beloved puzzle game Puyo Puyo, which will mark its 35th anniversary. The company has unveiled the "Dairensa!" project, a nod to a popular song from the franchise, and has promised a series of exciting initiatives to commemorate this milestone.

Fans can look forward to a special live stream on February 1, 2026, featuring voice actors, live demos, and updates on the mobile game Puyo Puyo!! Quest. Additionally, pop-up stores in major Japanese cities will offer exclusive merchandise, and a collaborative lottery event will allow fans to win themed prizes. This celebration not only honors Puyo Puyo's legacy but also highlights SEGA's commitment to engaging its community through interactive events and unique offerings.

With both Sonic and Puyo Puyo celebrating significant anniversaries, it will be fascinating to see how SEGA intertwines these two iconic franchises. Will there be more surprises in store for fans? Stay tuned!
