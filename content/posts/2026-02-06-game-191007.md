Konami is set to delight fans with a nostalgic trip down memory lane as it announces the release of a 13-game Goemon collection this summer for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Steam. This compilation, titled "Ganbare Goemon! Daishuugou," features beloved classics from the Famicom, Super Famicom, and Game Boy eras, showcasing the charm and humor that made the series a standout in the gaming world.

While the collection is currently slated for release only in Japan, it promises to include exciting new features such as rewind, quick save, turbo buttons, and a music player, enhancing the gameplay experience for both new and returning players. The inclusion of a gallery displaying each games instruction manual adds a nostalgic touch, making this collection a must-have for fans of the franchise.

As we look forward to the launch on July 2, one can't help but wonder if Konami will consider a global release in the future. Will this collection spark renewed interest in the Goemon series beyond Japan? Only time will tell.
