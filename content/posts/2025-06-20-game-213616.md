In a groundbreaking move, domestic game companies are embracing a unique way to reward their development teams: by gifting them the highly sought-after Nintendo Switch 2. This trend not only highlights the importance of employee recognition in the gaming industry but also reflects the competitive nature of game development, where innovation and performance are paramount.

Neowiz recently announced a generous incentive program for its developers, offering 10 million won per person and two weeks of reward leave in celebration of the global success of their action RPG "P's False." This initiative is further enhanced by the promise of a Nintendo Switch 2 for every member of the ROUND 8 studio, which comprises around 300 employees. Similarly, ShiftUp has also joined the bandwagon, rewarding its entire staff with the same console following the impressive sales of "Stella Blade." These gestures underscore a growing trend where companies are not just focused on profits but are also investing in their talent.

As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, such rewards may become a standard practice, fostering an environment where creativity and hard work are recognized and celebrated. Will we see more companies adopting similar strategies to motivate their teams? Only time will tell.
