UnLoop, the upcoming puzzle game from CM Games, is set to revolutionize the way we think about time manipulation in gaming. Slated for release on Quest and Pico this fall, this game invites players to engage in a unique temporal experience where they literally help themselves by recording and stacking their actions. This innovative mechanic not only enhances the puzzle-solving experience but also creates a deeply immersive gameplay loop that challenges players to think creatively and strategically.

Set in the visually striking Temporal Research Hub, players must navigate a labyrinth of obstacles, including turrets and laser walls, to retrieve critical data. The game’s design encourages experimentation, allowing players to throw objects and record voice memos to keep track of their loops. When things inevitably go awry, players can delete and rewrite their previous actions, making each attempt a new opportunity for success. The segmented Atompunk map, featuring areas like the Nexus Frame and Asset Assembly Factory, adds layers of complexity and excitement to the gameplay.

As we anticipate the launch of UnLoop, it’s clear that this game is not just about solving puzzles; it’s about engaging with time itself in a way that has never been done before. Will you be ready to embrace the chaos and master the art of time manipulation?
