In a shocking turn of events, hardware sales and physical game spending in the US have hit their lowest point in 30 years this November. According to Circana, only 1.6 million units of video game hardware were sold, a stark contrast to the 1.4 million units sold back in 1995. This decline is compounded by a staggering 27% drop in monthly hardware spending, totaling just $695 million, marking the worst performance for this month since 2005.

The average price for new video game hardware reached an all-time high of $439, which likely contributed to the drop in sales. Despite the usual surge in purchases during November due to Black Friday and holiday shopping, consumers are feeling the pinch of rising prices. The PlayStation 5 emerged as the best-selling console, but even the popular Call of Duty franchise reported a decline in sales compared to last year.

As we look to the future, the question remains: can console manufacturers find a way to lower prices amidst increasing component costs? The gaming landscape is shifting, and it will be interesting to see how these trends evolve in the coming months.
