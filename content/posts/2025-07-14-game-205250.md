In an unexpected turn of events, the PS5 has welcomed the surprise release of the 2021 Nintendo Switch exclusive game, Worlds End Club. This action-adventure puzzle game, developed by Too Kyo Games and directed by Danganronpa creator Kazutaka Kodaka, is now available on the PS Store for $24.99. However, its worth noting that there is no PS4 version available, which raises questions about the game's accessibility for a broader audience.

Worlds End Club takes players on a thrilling journey with a group of Tokyo school children who find themselves trapped in a mysterious underwater theme park after a bus accident. The game originally launched on Apple Arcade and later became a Switch exclusive, making this PS5 release a significant moment for fans eager to experience the unique narrative and gameplay.

As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, it will be interesting to see how other exclusive titles make their way to different platforms. Will we see more surprises like this in the future?
