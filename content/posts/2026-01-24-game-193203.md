Game Freak's upcoming action RPG, Beast of Reincarnation, is not just a product of its internal team; instead, the studio is leveraging a wide network of partner studios to bring its vision to life. This approach highlights a significant shift in how major game developers are structuring their projects, especially when tackling ambitious titles that require extensive resources and expertise.

The game, which follows the journey of Emma and her wolf companion Koo in a world overrun by parasitic plants, is being developed with a relatively small core team at Game Freak. As director Kota Furushima noted, while the internal team is essential for direction and management, the bulk of the development is outsourced to various studios that can help realize the game's expansive vision. This strategy not only allows for a diverse range of skills and ideas but also enables Game Freak to maintain its focus on the Pokmon series while still innovating in new genres.

As we look forward to the release of Beast of Reincarnation this summer on multiple platforms, it raises an intriguing question: will this outsourcing model become the new norm in the gaming industry, allowing studios to balance multiple projects without compromising on quality?
