The recent launch of the PC version of **Stellar Blade** has marked a significant milestone in the gaming world, as it becomes the second PlayStation-published game to surpass 100,000 concurrent players on Steam. With a current all-time peak of 100,904 players, this achievement highlights the growing popularity of PlayStation titles in the PC gaming arena, especially as more players seek immersive experiences on Steam.

While **Stellar Blade** has made a strong entrance, it still trails behind **Helldivers 2**, which set an impressive record of 458,709 concurrent players last year. This comparison not only emphasizes the competitive landscape of PlayStation games on Steam but also raises questions about what future titles might achieve as the gaming community continues to expand. 

As we look ahead, it will be interesting to see how **Stellar Blade** maintains its momentum and whether it can inspire other PlayStation titles to make the leap to PC. Will we witness more PlayStation games breaking through the 100,000 barrier? Only time will tell.
