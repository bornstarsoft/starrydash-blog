The gaming community is buzzing with excitement as leaks about the Switch 2 version of Assassin's Creed Shadows have surfaced, hinting at a release date of December 5, 2025. According to the reliable insider billbil-kun, the game will be available in both digital and physical formats, with the physical edition being a Game-Key card priced around 50 in Europe. This news comes as Ubisoft has yet to officially announce the game for the new console, but the mounting evidence suggests that its only a matter of time.

Adding to the anticipation, a pre-order phase is expected to launch before November 7, though the exact date remains unconfirmed. The excitement is palpable, especially after the successful port of Ubisofts Star Wars Outlaws to the Switch, which received rave reviews for its performance. With Assassin's Creed Shadows promising an expansive world and engaging gameplay, fans are eager to see how this beloved franchise will adapt to the Switch 2's capabilities.

As we await the official announcement from Ubisoft, one has to wonder: will this release reignite the franchise's popularity and restore confidence among fans? The gaming world is watching closely, and December 5 could mark a significant moment for both Ubisoft and Switch 2 enthusiasts.
