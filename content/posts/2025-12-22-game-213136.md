The Octopath Traveler series has reached an impressive milestone, surpassing 6 million units sold globally. This achievement, announced by Square Enix, combines sales from the original Octopath Traveler, its sequel, and the newly released Octopath Traveler 0. This growth in sales reflects the franchise's increasing popularity and the positive reception of its unique gameplay and art style.

Just a year ago, the series celebrated 5 million units sold, highlighting a significant increase in sales momentum. The first game alone crossed the 3 million mark by September 2022, while Octopath Traveler II achieved 1 million sales by June 2023. To celebrate this achievement, Square Enix is offering a 60% discount on the first two games during the holiday season, making it a perfect time for new players to dive into this captivating world.

As the series continues to expand and attract new fans, one can't help but wonder what the future holds for Octopath Traveler. Will we see more entries in the franchise, or perhaps even a new direction for the beloved characters? The gaming community eagerly awaits the next chapter in this journey.
