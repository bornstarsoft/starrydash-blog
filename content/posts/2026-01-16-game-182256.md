In a surprising turn of events, Amazon Games has confirmed that its MMO, New World: Aeternum, will be permanently taken offline on January 31, 2027. This announcement comes after the game was pulled from storefronts, including Steam and the Xbox store, marking the end of an era for players who have invested time and resources into this virtual world.

The decision to shut down New World follows Amazon's strategic shift away from MMO development, leaving many players wondering about the future of their beloved game. While those who have purchased the game will still be able to download and install it, they will no longer have access to its features after the shutdown date. The final year will be an opportunity for players to enjoy the game one last time, as the Nighthaven season will be extended until the servers go offline.

As we reflect on the journey of New World: Aeternum, it's essential to recognize the community that has formed around it. Amazon Games expressed gratitude for the players' dedication, emphasizing the shared experiences that made this game special. With the clock ticking down to the final shutdown, how will players commemorate their adventures in Aeternum? Will they rally together for one last epic quest? Only time will tell.
