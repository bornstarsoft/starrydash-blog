Long-lost NES puzzle game Xcavator, originally developed by Chris Oberth in 1991 and never released, is making a triumphant return thanks to a partnership between iam8bit and the Video Game History Foundation. This fully polished cartridge edition, priced at $100, not only revives a piece of gaming history but also includes a detailed manual that chronicles the games troubled past, Oberths career, and the broader challenges of preserving 8-bit history.

The release of Xcavator in 2025 serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of preserving video game history. With profits supporting the Video Game History Foundations archival efforts, this project highlights the ongoing struggle to maintain the legacy of classic games that shaped the industry. As we celebrate this revival, it prompts us to reflect on what other hidden gems might still be waiting to be discovered in the annals of gaming history.
