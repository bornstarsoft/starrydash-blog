Amazon Prime Gaming is turning up the excitement this June by adding six more free games to its already impressive lineup. As part of the ongoing celebration for Prime Day, members can now claim titles that include classics like *Tomb Raider I-III Remastered* and fan-favorites such as *Saints Row II* and *Star Wars: Rebellion*. This is a fantastic opportunity for gamers to expand their libraries without spending a dime.

Starting today, June 17, at 9 AM PT, these games are available for claim on the Amazon Prime Gaming page. The best part? Once you redeem these titles, they remain yours to enjoy, even if you decide to cancel your Amazon Prime subscription later on. This flexibility is a significant draw for gamers who want to explore new titles without the commitment of a long-term subscription.

With a diverse selection that caters to various tastes, from indie gems like *TOEM* to the strategic depth of *Dungeon of the Endless: Definitive Edition*, there's something for everyone. As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, initiatives like this from Amazon Prime Gaming highlight the growing trend of providing value to subscribers through exclusive content. What will you play first?
