A new Nintendo Direct is set to take place next week, focusing exclusively on third-party games for the Nintendo Switch and the upcoming Switch 2. According to sources like NatetheHate and GameXplain, this Partner Direct is scheduled for Thursday, February 5, and promises to unveil exciting titles that are not developed by Nintendo's internal studios. This event follows a successful Partner Direct held last July, which showcased popular games such as Final Fantasy Tactics and Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment.

As the Switch 2 continues to gain momentum, with 4.4 million units sold in the US, players are eagerly anticipating major announcements from third-party developers. Confirmed titles for the Switch 2 include highly anticipated games like Elden Ring and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. However, industry analysts are also speculating about a potential price increase for the Switch 2 due to various economic factors, which could impact consumer interest moving forward.

With the gaming landscape constantly evolving, this upcoming Nintendo Direct could be a pivotal moment for fans and developers alike. What third-party titles are you hoping to see announced?
