Bungie has officially announced the release date and pricing for its highly anticipated extraction shooter, Marathon. Set to launch in March 2026, the game will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC for a price of $39.99. This announcement comes after a delay that allowed the developers to refine the game based on community feedback, ensuring a polished experience for players.

One of the standout features of Marathon is its commitment to a fair gaming environment, with no pay-to-win mechanics. Players will receive all gameplay updates, including new maps and events, without the pressure of expiring passes. This approach not only enhances the gaming experience but also builds trust within the community, which is crucial for the game's success.

As we look forward to the release, it's exciting to see how Bungie has incorporated player feedback into the development process. With new features like proximity chat and a solo experience mode, Marathon promises to deliver a rich and immersive world for both new and returning players. Will you be diving into this cybernetic adventure when it launches?
