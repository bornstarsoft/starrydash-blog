Square Enix has just unveiled an exciting new title, Killer Inn, a 24-player online murder mystery game that is set to captivate gamers when it launches on Steam. Developed by Tactic Studios, this game pits players against each other in a high-stakes environment where strategy, deduction, and survival are key. With teams divided into Wolves and Lambs, the tension builds as players must navigate a castle filled with danger and deception.

In Killer Inn, Wolves aim to eliminate Lambs while remaining undetected, creating a thrilling cat-and-mouse dynamic. The unique twist lies in the consequences of misidentification; if a Lamb mistakenly kills another Lamb, they too will face dire consequences. This mechanic not only heightens the stakes but also encourages players to think critically and work together to uncover the true identities of their opponents. The game also features intriguing elements like evidence collection and Focus Mode, which allows players to track down killers through various clues left behind.

As we look forward to the open beta release on Steam, Killer Inn promises to deliver an engaging blend of strategy and social interaction that could redefine the murder mystery genre in gaming. Will you be ready to solve the mystery or will you fall victim to the Wolves?
