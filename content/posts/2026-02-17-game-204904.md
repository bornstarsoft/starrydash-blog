The upcoming physical release of Rayman: 30th Anniversary Edition is a nostalgic celebration for fans of the beloved franchise. Scheduled for June 26, this edition not only includes five versions of the original Rayman game but also introduces new features aimed at making the experience more accessible for modern players. Priced at $29.99, it comes with collectible items like postcards and stickers, making it a must-have for collectors.

Developed by Digital Eclipse, this compilation also offers a unique glimpse into gaming history with a playable prototype of the canceled SNES version of Rayman. This marks a significant moment for fans, as it is the first official release of this prototype, alongside an interactive timeline filled with interviews and concept art from the original developers. 

As we look forward to the physical release, it's exciting to see how classic games are being revitalized for new audiences while honoring their rich history. Will you be adding this nostalgic collection to your gaming library?
