Pokemon Legends: Z-A has emerged as the best-selling physical game in the US for 2025, a testament to the enduring popularity of the franchise. According to Mat Piscatella from Circana, this game has not only topped the charts shortly after its release but has also set records for the best retail launch week in over two years. This impressive performance underscores the strength of the Pokemon brand, which continues to thrive across various media, including toys and trading cards.

The game's success is particularly noteworthy given that it achieved 5.8 million copies sold globally in its first week, with a significant portion played on the new Switch 2. As Pokemon Legends: Z-A captures the hearts of both new and veteran players, it raises the question of how it will influence the gaming landscape as we approach the holiday season. Will it maintain its momentum, or will other titles emerge to challenge its reign?
