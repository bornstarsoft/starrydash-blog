The gaming industry is about to witness a significant shift with the launch of Kinetic Publishing, a new label founded by Daniel Knight, the creator of the viral hit Phasmophobia. This initiative aims to support indie developers by providing funding and advisory services while firmly rejecting any projects that incorporate blockchain, web3, or AI-generated elements. Knight's vision is clear: to champion creativity and innovation within the indie gaming space.

Kinetic Publishing is actively seeking PC and console projects that are 12-18 months from completion, focusing on a diverse range of genres, from cozy games to RPGs. With a dedicated team and a commitment to nurturing indie talent, Kinetic aims to create an environment where developers can thrive without compromising their creative vision. As the indie game landscape continues to evolve, Kinetic Publishing could play a pivotal role in shaping its future.

As we look ahead, the question remains: will Kinetic Publishing set a new standard for indie game development, and how will this impact the broader gaming ecosystem? Let's keep an eye on this exciting development!
