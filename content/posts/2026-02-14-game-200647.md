The 2026 Taipei International Game Show was a vibrant showcase of gaming culture, and the "Dolls Frontline 2" booth stood out with its captivating cosplayers and interactive experiences. Fans were treated to a visual feast as they mingled with talented cosplayers portraying their favorite characters from the game, creating an electric atmosphere that highlighted the community's passion.

At the booth, attendees could engage with a Memory Puzzle Game, which cleverly tied into the app's mechanics, rewarding players based on their commander level. This innovative approach not only entertained but also encouraged deeper engagement with the game. Characters like Macchiato and Suomi in their stunning outfits drew crowds, blending cuteness with a touch of coolness that left a lasting impression.

As we reflect on this event, it's clear that the intersection of gaming and cosplay continues to thrive, fostering a sense of community and creativity. What will the next gaming event bring to the table in terms of fan engagement and interactive experiences?
