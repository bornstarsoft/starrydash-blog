After over two decades of writing about games, I am thrilled to share a personal milestone: I am now officially credited in a video game! My journey in the gaming industry has been filled with writing, influencing, and promoting countless titles, but seeing my name in the credits of AHRO, an experimental indie game by OEH Interactive, is a dream come true. This unique game, which emphasizes deep lore and avoids combat, has just launched its free v2.0 version on platforms like Steam, Switch, Linux, and Atari VCS.

Being part of the QA and promotional efforts for AHRO has been an incredible experience. Its not just about the credit; its about contributing to a project that resonates with my passion for innovative storytelling in games. This achievement has been on my bucket list since childhood, and I feel honored to have played a role in such a distinctive title.

As I reflect on this milestone, I can't help but wonder what the future holds for indie games and my role within this vibrant community. What unique experiences will the next project bring?
