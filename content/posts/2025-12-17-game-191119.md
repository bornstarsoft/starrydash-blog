November 2025 proved to be a remarkable month for anime-style RPGs in China's livestreaming scene, as these titles captured the attention of millions of viewers. According to the Niko Partners China Games & Livestreaming Tracker, the genre's popularity surged, primarily due to significant version updates and anniversary events that drew in massive audiences across platforms like Bilibili, Huya, and Douyu.

Among the standout titles, Kuro Games' "Wuthering Waves" and miHoYo's "Zenless Zone Zero" both experienced impressive viewership spikes, thanks to their respective update previews aired on November 14. These events not only showcased new content but also highlighted how critical livestreaming platforms have become for engaging with the gaming community, particularly among younger audiences who resonate with ACGN culture.

As we look ahead, the success of these RPG titles raises intriguing questions about the future of livestreaming in gaming. Will we see even more innovative ways to engage viewers and enhance the gaming experience? The landscape is evolving rapidly, and it will be exciting to see how developers and streamers adapt to these changes.
