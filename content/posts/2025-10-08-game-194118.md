In an inspiring testament to community spirit, a charity quiz has raised over 2 million for Marie Curie over the past 18 years. This annual event, organized by the North East fundraising group, brings together teams from across the region to compete in a fun and engaging quiz night, all while supporting a noble cause.

Marie Curie plays a crucial role in providing care and support for individuals living with terminal illnesses and their families. The funds generated from this quiz directly contribute to essential services, including nursing care and family support. The event has become a beloved tradition, with many teams returning year after year, showcasing the power of collective effort in making a difference.

As we reflect on the success of this event, it raises an important question: how can we leverage technology and community engagement to further amplify charitable efforts in the future?
