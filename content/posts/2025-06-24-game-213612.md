BitSummit 2025 is set to be a groundbreaking event for indie game enthusiasts, showcasing an impressive lineup of 120 games from Japan and around the globe. This year's expo, themed "Summer of Yokai," will take place from July 19 to July 21 at the Miyako Messe in Kyoto, marking the 13th iteration of this beloved gathering. The event promises to celebrate the creativity and innovation that indie developers bring to the gaming landscape.

Founded in 2012 by the Japan Independent Games Aggregate (JIGA), BitSummit has grown from a modest gathering of industry insiders to a vibrant festival attracting over 38,000 attendees last year. The event not only highlights the best in indie gaming but also serves as a platform for developers to connect with fans and industry professionals. As John Davis, co-founder of JIGA, noted, the selection process for this yearâ€™s lineup was challenging due to the sheer volume of outstanding submissions from around the world.

With tickets now available for purchase, both local and international attendees can look forward to a weekend filled with unique gaming experiences. As VGC continues its partnership with BitSummit, fans can expect comprehensive coverage of the event, including daily reports and highlights of standout games. Will you be among the thousands celebrating indie creativity this July?
